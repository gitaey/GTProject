# 서드파티 소프트웨어 고지 (Third-party software notices)

UMD 번들에 들어가는 오픈소스 패키지와 라이선스 원문이다. **빌드할 때마다 `dist/`에 같은 내용이 자동으로 생긴다** — 배포할 때는 번들 옆에
`dist/gis-map.THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`(또는 attach 번들이면 `dist/gis-map.attach.THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`)를 함께 둔다.
이 파일은 그 두 파일에서 만든 저장소용 사본이다(의존성 버전이 바뀌면 다시 만든다). 원문은 각 패키지 배포본의 LICENSE 파일을 그대로 옮긴 것이다.

| 패키지 | 버전 | 라이선스 | (a) `gis-map.umd.js`·`gis-map.es.js` | (b) `gis-map.attach.umd.js` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| color-name | 2.1.0 | MIT | 포함 | - |
| color-parse | 2.0.2 | MIT | 포함 | - |
| color-rgba | 3.0.0 | MIT | 포함 | - |
| color-space | 2.3.2 | Unlicense | 포함 | - |
| mgrs | 1.0.0 | MIT | 포함 | 포함 |
| ol | 9.2.4 | BSD-2-Clause | 포함 | - |
| ol-wind | 1.1.9 | MIT | 포함 | 포함 |
| proj4 | 2.20.2 | MIT | 포함 | 포함 |
| quickselect | 2.0.0 | ISC | 포함 | - |
| rbush | 3.0.1 | MIT | 포함 | - |
| wind-core | 1.1.8 | MIT | 포함 | 포함 |
| wkt-parser | 1.5.2 | MIT | 포함 | 포함 |

- (b)에는 OpenLayers가 들어 있지 않다. 업무 화면이 따로 불러오는 `ol.js`의 고지는 그 배포본을 따른다.
- React 위젯(`src/ui`, `src/react`)을 앱 번들러로 쓸 때는 앱 쪽 고지 절차를 따른다(이 표는 UMD 번들 기준).
